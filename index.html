                            Brent crude oil futures rose to around $62.4 per barrel on Friday, building on a more than 3% gain in the previous session, the largest since last October, as markets continued to weigh geopolitical risks. President Donald Trump warned Iran of a “hard” response if its government caused protesters to lose their lives, reigniting concerns over potential supply disruptions from one of OPEC’s largest producers. Traders also digested news that Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump approved a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill targeting countries buying discounted Russian oil that funds Moscow’s war. Meanwhile, US actions in Venezuela remained in focus after Washington seized two oil tankers linked to the country in the Atlantic, including one flying a Russian flag, highlighting Trump’s intensified efforts to control energy flows in the Americas and pressure Venezuela’s socialist government. For the week, oil is on track for a third consecutive advance.

                            Gold fell to around $4,460 per ounce on Thursday, giving back some gains from the previous session as the US dollar strengthened ahead of key US jobs data. Investors are anticipating stronger nonfarm payrolls in December, while unemployment is expected to remain steady. The latest report could influence monetary policy expectations for this year, with markets currently pricing in two reductions. Meanwhile, the metal is still heading for a weekly gain of about 3%, supported by escalating geopolitical risks that have bolstered safe-haven demand. President Trump warned of a strong response to potential Iranian violence against protesters, a statement that followed recent US actions in Venezuela and subsequent threats to seize control of Greenland using military force. Elsewhere, bullion received support from continued central-bank purchases, with China extending its gold-buying streak for a 14th month.

                            US stock futures were little changed on Friday as investors awaited the December jobs report, a key data point expected to provide further insight into labor market conditions and the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook. Markets were also focused on a potential US Supreme Court ruling regarding the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. In regular trading on Thursday, the Dow rose 0.55%, the S&P 500 edged up 0.01%, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.44%. The session reflected a rotation out of high-growth technology stocks into other sectors amid increasing scrutiny over AI-related capital expenditures. Semiconductor and AI-linked stocks led the declines, including Nvidia (-2.2%), Micron Technology (-3.7%), Broadcom (-3.2%), AMD (-2.5%) and Palatir (-2.7%). In contrast, defense stocks rallied after President Trump called for a $1.5 trillion US military budget for 2027, with Lockheed Martin up 4.4%, Northrop Grumman 2.4%, and Kratos Defense 13.8%.

                            The CAC 40 rose 0.5% to a record 8,290 on Friday, extending gains from the previous session, driven by strong performances in luxury stocks and a positive catalyst from BNP Paribas. French beauty and luxury giant L’Oréal announced the acquisition of Kering’s cosmetics business, valued at around €4 billion. The deal, the largest in L’Oréal’s recent series of luxury brand expansions, is expected to close in the first half of 2026. The announcement lifted luxury shares, with L’Oréal +4.0%, LVMH +1.5%, Hermès +2.2%, and Kering +2.4%. Meanwhile, BNP Paribas jumped 3.1% after UBS upgraded the stock from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Buy’, raising its 12-month price target. Other notable gainers included Saint-Gobain +2.8%, Publicis +2.0%, Stellantis NV +1.9%, and TotalEnergies SE +1.5%. On the downside, Bouygues fell 2.3% leading losses, followed by Societe Generale -1.9%, Safran -1.8%, and Vinci -1.7%.

                            The DAX in Frankfurt edged up to around 25,140 on Friday, notching a ninth consecutive gain and pushing toward fresh record levels. Traders continued to closely monitor geopolitical developments while also keeping an eye on economic data. On the domestic front, Germany’s industrial output unexpectedly rose in November, recording three consecutive months of growth for the first time since 2022. Meanwhile, attention turned to the key US jobs report due later in the day, with investors also watching for a possible Supreme Court decision on tariffs. On equities, top gainers included Zalando (2.7%), Siemens Energy (2.5%) and Adidas (2%). Fresenius Medical Care (+1.7%) was also in focus, after announcing the continuation of its €1 billion share buyback program, with a second tranche of €415 million running from January 12 to May 8. Infineon Technologies and SAP rose 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively, as European tech stocks followed a surge in ASML Holding. The DAX heads for a 2.4% weekly gain.

                            The FTSE 100 traded higher on Friday, snapping a two-day losing streak as strength in energy, defence and mining stocks lifted the index back into positive territory. Gains were led by the mining sector after reports of talks between Glencore and Rio Tinto over a potential mega-deal sparked merger-and-acquisition optimism. Glencore shares jumped around 7.5%, hitting their highest level since July 2024, while other miners such as Antofagasta and Anglo American also advanced as deal speculation spread across the sector. In contrast, Rio Tinto shares fell about 3%. Oil majors Shell and BP rose more than 1.5% as crude prices climbed for a second straight session, while defence stocks, including Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, gained over 1% amid continued support for the sector. Meanwhile, healthcare stocks lagged, and retailers underperformed after Sainsbury’s shares fell more than 5% following a subdued festive trading update.

                            The STOXX 50 rose 0.5% and the STOXX 600 gained 0.4% on Friday, marking their first advance in three sessions and pushing both indexes to fresh record highs. The mining sector was in the spotlight, with Glencore shares jumping nearly 7% after reports that Rio Tinto is in talks to acquire the company. The deal would create the world’s largest mining group, with a combined market value exceeding $200 billion, just over a year after previous negotiations between the two firms collapsed. Shares of Rio Tinto, however, fell 2.7%. Anglo American advanced 1.8%, while Norsk Hydro edged up 0.2%. The technology sector also traded higher, led by a 3.5% surge in ASML Holding. SAP added 0.3%, and Infineon gained 1.4%. By contrast, Sainsbury’s shares fell nearly 5%, making it one of the worst performer on the STOXX 600, after the supermarket chain reported disappointing Christmas trading results. For the first week of 2026, the STOXX 50 rose 0.9%, while the STOXX 600 added 1.2%.
