                            Brent crude oil futures rose around 2% to above $61 per barrel on Thursday, rebounding from a two day slide as markets reassessed near term supply risks against firmer US physical balances. The move followed a larger than expected 3.8 million barrel draw in US crude inventories, countering expectations for a build and offsetting concerns about ample global supply. Uncertainty around Venezuelan flows resurfaced after Washington outlined plans to exert greater control over crude sales and intensified sanctions enforcement by seizing Venezuela linked tankers. While President Trump’s comments on potential transfers of Venezuelan crude to the US reinforced longer term supply risks, execution and logistical constraints limited downside pressure. Gains were capped by rising stocks at Cushing and sharp builds in gasoline and distillates, though softer US labor data continued to support demand expectations via a more accommodative Fed outlook.

                            Gold dipped to around $4,440 per ounce on Thursday, extending losses from the previous session, as investors assessed mixed US economic data while geopolitical developments remained a key focus. Job openings dropped more than expected in November, signaling softer labor demand, while private payrolls in December increased less than expected. However, ISM data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the services sector. Investors are now looking ahead to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for guidance on the central bank’s policy direction, with markets pricing in two rate cuts for the year. On the geopolitical front, Washington outlined plans to take long-term control over Venezuelan crude sales, while US authorities seized additional Venezuelan-linked tankers. The White House also confirmed discussions on acquiring Greenland, including potential military involvement. Elsewhere, China’s central bank extended its gold-buying streak to 14 months in December.

                            European natural gas prices were at the €28 per MWh mark in early January, remaining relatively close to the 20-month low of €26.8 tested through mid-December as ample supply levels lowered asking prices in Europe's main gas hubs. Record-high gas output in the US throughout last year and the culmination of fresh supply contracts with Middle Eastern producers resulted in a 28% increase in LNG imports to Europe annually in 2025. The higher sourcing from LNG combined with steady supply from Norwegian pipelines, extending higher quantity of the alternative purchases into Europe since efforts to move away from Russian energy in 2022. On the demand front, forecasts indicated that lower winter temperatures should moderate later in January, limiting gas-intensive heating generation. Still, stocks remained firmly below their five-year average at under 60%.

                            US stocks diverged between sectors on Thursday amid lingering uncertainty on the magnitude of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year and fundamentals behind AI capital expenditure pledges. The S&P 500 and the Dow inched higher, while losses for tech heavyweights pressured the Nasdaq 100 to fall by 0.5%. Heavyweight tech companies mostly held their pullback form last session, remaining under closer scrutiny after speculative bets on higher AI implementation worldwide drove software and datacenter infrastructure carried equity returns last year. Broadcom, Oracle, and Micron fell more than 3%. Meanwhile, defense companies surged after President Trump announced the US military budget would rise to $1.5 trillion for 2027, extending the sector's recent push on the US's capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and the White House's hawkish rhetoric on Greenland. Lockheed Martin, RTX, and Northrop Grumman gained between 4% and 8%.

                            The CAC 40 edged up 0.1% to close at 8,244 on Thursday, trimming the modest losses seen in the prior session as investors remained cautious amid persistent geopolitical risks. Banks led the advance, with BNP Paribas jumping 3.5%, Credit Agricole gaining 1.4%, and Societe Generale rising 1.8%. Luxury stocks also outperformed, with LVMH, Hermes, L'Oréal, and Kering advancing between 0.8% and 1.9%. By contrast, Saint-Gobain fell 1.8% after UBS downgraded the stock to sell and cut its target price to €78 from €92, while the company also flagged plans to delist from the London Stock Exchange. Other notable laggards included Schneider Electric (-4.1%), Renault (-2.6%), and Legrand (-2.7%).

                            The DAX in Frankfurt closed virtually unchanged at 25,127.5 on Thursday, though scaling new highs, amid some slight profit-taking after successive record sessions. Market sentiment was supported by the prospect of higher military spending on both sides of the Atlantic in an increasingly tense geopolitical environment. Also supportive, factory new orders in Germany jumped 5.6% in November, building on strong gains in the previous two months, which bodes well for the economic recovery. Defense stocks continued to see buying interest, with Renk rising 2.9% and Rheinmetall adding 1.2%. Deutsche Telekom (3.4%), Bayer (3.1%), Adidas (2.6%) and Commerzbank (1.9%) also performed strongly. On the flip side, Siemens Energy (-3.7%), Infineon Technologies (-3.6%) and Zalando (-2.3%) emerged as the top losers.

                            The FTSE 100 fell on Thursday, extending losses after a 0.7% decline the previous session, as weak corporate updates weighed on sentiment. Associated British Foods shares fell more than 12% after the group issued a profit warning, sending the stock to its lowest level since March. The warning was driven mainly by Primark, which suffered a difficult Christmas amid a challenging UK clothing market, weaker sales in continental Europe and a volatile US retail backdrop. Slower sales growth and higher markdowns to clear excess stock are expected to pressure margins, while the group’s grocery and ingredients divisions also delivered softer-than-expected results. Tesco shares dropped about 6.5% after UK like-for-like sales growth narrowly missed forecasts, despite strong Christmas trading and guidance for profit at the upper end of expectations. Finally, housing data from Halifax showed that UK house prices fell 0.6% in December, after a 0.1% drop seen in November.

                            European stocks inched lower on Thursday, extending the slight breather from yesterday after reaching record highs this week amid uncertainty about the ECB's policy path this year and lingering geopolitical concerns. The Eurozone's STOXX 50 eased 0.3% to 5,903 and the pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2% to 604. Tech stocks trimmed their gains from the prior session, tracking the poor momentum for the sector in the US amid lingering risks that exaggerated investments will not result in the returns that were pledged, with ASML, Infineon, and Prosus dropping between 4% and 2%. On the other hand, banks closed sharply higher with BNP Paribas jumping 3.5%. In turn, defense rose further with Leonardo, BAE Systems, and SAAB gaining between 6% and 2% amid the White House's hawkish rhetoric against Greenland.
