                            Brent crude oil advanced 2.2% to settle at $63.3 per barrel on Friday, as markets reacted to rising geopolitical tensions and growing concerns over supply risks tied to Iran and Venezuela. Prices climbed for a second consecutive session, rebounding from earlier losses and leaving Brent for a 2.8% weekly gain. Escalating protests in Iran, including reports of mounting casualties and a nationwide internet blackout, heightened fears of potential disruptions from one of the world’s key oil exporters. Those concerns pushed risk premiums higher, with traders increasingly positioning for further upside. At the same time, uncertainty persisted around Venezuelan supply after the US moved to assert control over the country’s oil exports, adding to market unease. Broader geopolitical risks, including the possibility of spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine war, further supported prices.

                            Gold rose around 0.3% to above 4,490 per ounce paring early losses as softer US labor data reinforced expectations for Fed rate cuts this year. December nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000, well below forecasts, while the unemployment rate fell sharply to 4.4%, confirming a low-hiring, low-firing environment that supports lower interest rates without signaling major labor market stress. That shift increased demand for non-yielding assets even as the US dollar remained relatively firm, limiting upside momentum. Geopolitical risks continued to underpin bullion, following renewed US actions and rhetoric around Venezuela and Iran, while structural support remained strong as China’s central bank extended its gold-buying streak to 14 months, tightening available supply and helping gold retain a weekly gain of around 3%.

                            US stocks closed at record highs on Friday as investors reacted to the December jobs report and awaited potential Fed guidance. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% and the Dow rose 0.5%, both hitting new highs, while the Nasdaq added 0.8%. The December report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 50,000, below expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, signaling a labor market that remains steady but slow-growing. Chipmakers led sector gains, with Broadcom (+3.8%), Intel (+10.8%), and Lam Research (+8.7%) climbing sharply on investor optimism over AI and semiconductor growth. Homebuilders and home improvement stocks also advanced after President Trump directed mortgage bond purchases to lower rates, with D.R. Horton (+7.8%), PulteGroup (+7.3%), Lennar (+8.8%), and Home Depot (+2.2%) all rising. For the week, all three major indexes posted solid gains, with the S&P 500 up 1%, the Nasdaq rising 1.3%, and the Dow advancing 1.2%.

                            The CAC 40 climbed 1.4% to close at a record high of 8,362 on Friday, extending the prior session’s gains and securing a weekly advance of 1.8%, driven by strength in luxury names and a sharp rally in BNP Paribas. L’Oréal announced the acquisition of Kering’s cosmetics business for about €4 billion, marking its largest luxury expansion in recent years and lifting the sector broadly. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, pushed L’Oréal shares up 6.3%, while LVMH rose 2.8%, Hermès gained 3.7%, and Kering advanced 2.5%. Meanwhile, BNP Paribas surged 5.7% after UBS upgraded the stock to Buy and raised its 12 month price target. Other notable gainers included TotalEnergies up 3.3%, STMicroelectronics 2.9%, Saint Gobain 2.4%, Capgemini 2.3%, and Dassault Systèmes 1.9%. On the downside, Orange led declines with a 2.9% drop, followed by Bouygues and Vinci, both down 2.2%.

                            The DAX in Frankfurt moved higher to close 0.5% up at 25,258 on Friday, scaling new highs, as traders digested the latest US jobs report while also monitoring geopolitical developments. The US job market showed signs of cooling in December, with slower hiring but a falling unemployment rate, reducing expectations of a Fed rate cut later this month. On the domestic front, Germany’s industrial output unexpectedly rose for the third month in November, but exports declined. Defense names such as Hensoldt (5.6%), Rheinmetall (2.6%) and Renk (1%) outperformed. SAP and Infineon Technologies climbed 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively, tracking strong performance among chip giants in Amsterdam. Fresenius Medical Care rose 1.3% after announcing the continuation of its €1 billion share buyback program. Among losers, insurers Allianz (-1.8%), Munich Re (-1.1%) and Hannover Re (-1%) faced pressure after Morgan Stanley cited the challenging industry environment. For the week, the index added 2.9%.

                            The FTSE 100 rose 0.8% to a new record of 10128 on Friday, snapping a two-day losing streak as strength in energy, defence and mining stocks lifted the index back into positive territory. Gains were led by the mining sector after reports of talks between Glencore and Rio Tinto over a potential mega-deal sparked merger-and-acquisition optimism. Glencore shares jumped around 8.5%, hitting their highest level since July 2024, while other miners such as Antofagasta and Anglo American also advanced as deal speculation spread across the sector. In contrast, Rio Tinto shares fell about 3%. Oil majors Shell and BP rose 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively, as crude prices climbed for a second straight session, while defence stocks, including Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, gained over 1.5% amid continued support for the sector. Meanwhile, healthcare stocks lagged, and retailers underperformed after Sainsbury’s shares fell more than 5% following a subdued festive trading update.

                            European stocks closed sharply higher on Friday, recovering from losses earlier in the week amid positive corporate news and an outlook of a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The Eurozone's STOXX 50 jumped 1.6% to close at 5,996, while the pan-European STOXX 600 gained 1% to 610. Tech shares closed a volatile week sharply higher, tracking the strong momentum for the sector in the United States with ASML surging close to 7%, while SAP and Infineon added over 2% each. Luxury also performed well despite uncertainty over the outlook for Chinese clients, with Hermes, LVMH, and L'Oreal adding between 6% and 3%, with the latter announcing the acquisition of Kering's cosmetics business. Outside the currency bloc, Glencore surged 8% after resuming talks with Rio Tinto (-2%) on their potential $260 billion merger.
